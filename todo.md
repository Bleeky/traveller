# This is a simple reminder for the project dependencies

The Traveller project is about to begin beeing developed. This short file allows me to write my ideas about dependencies and interesting resources for the project.

## This project will use (for sure) :

- gulp
- bower dependencies
- npm dependencies
- karma
- jasmine
- restangular
- angular-breadcrumb
- angular-ui-router
- angular-loading-bar
- angular-file-upload
- angular-cookies
- jshint
- jscs

## This project might use (to check out) :

- underscore
- lazyjs
- basscss
- protractor
- browserify
- Travis CI

## Questions to answer :

1. How to organize the 'assets' folder ?
2. Would it be interesting to use @Docker ?
