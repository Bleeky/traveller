# This is a simple reminder for the project dependencies

The Traveller project is about to begin beeing developed. This short file allows me to write my ideas about dependencies and interesting resources for the project.

## This project will use (for sure) :

- gulp
- bower dependencies
- npm dependencies
- karma framework
- jasmine framework
- restangular
- angular-ui-router
- angular-loading-bar
- angular-file-upload
- angular-cookies
- browser-sync
- jshint
- jscs
- lodash
- gulp-uglify
- gulp-minify-css
- gulp-watch
- gulp-concat
- rimraf
- basscss

## This project might use (to check out) :

- angular-breadcrumb
- underscore
- lazyjs
- protractor
- browserify
- Travis CI
- Jenkins
- Restclient Atom Package
- gulp-livereload
- gulp-util
- gulp-karma
- gulp-sync
- gulp-plumber : error handling for gulp streams.
- gulp-dir
- glob
- gulp-imagemin
- gulp-notify
- gulp-git
- gulp-uncss
- gulp-rsync
- gulp-scp2
- gulp-cached
- gulp-jsdoc
- gulp-obfuscate
- gulp : run-sequence
- Atom : gulp-control
- fs (Node)
- mkdirp
- font-awesome
- modernizr/polyfills
- Eslint (Slower)
- Lazyr.js
- imagesloaded
- atom/web-browser
- socket.io
- Pusher
- KSS (For css documentation)
- JsDoc
- Atom package : jsdoc package

## Questions to answer :

1. How to organize the 'assets' folder ?
2. Would it be interesting to use @Docker ? Yes.
3. Lookup at Socket.io and Pusher
4. Comparison between NodeJs (Express) and Go for the Back-end.
5. How to make my personnal icons files and use them ?
6. First mockup of the main page.
7. Define coding style, and set linters properly for the Javascript/SCSS.
8. Gulp command for deploying on server.
9. Gulp command for pull/push/commit request, with unit tests launched.
10. Gulp command for launching shell commands.

## Next to-do :

1. Correct the dependencies.json file (no Js/Css).
2. Setup notifications for Gulp and Karma when building/testing.
3. Lookup for JSDoc.
4. Resolve the Browser-Sync problem when a change occurs (look around the BuildCssDependencies pipe callback).
5. Launch the linters in the Gulp.
6. Setup the merge process : the linters must be okay before merging.
7. Look for CSS LazyLoading.
8. Look for nice browser testing tools.
